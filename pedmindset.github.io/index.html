        <p>How do i start this; being a young boy in Ghana and  growing up i never really had ambitions of starting a business. The turn around came when i started following a renowned motivator( Pst Chris) and teacher who challenge my belief, perceptions and the way i perceived myself and the world as a whole.</p>
        <p>Years down the line; i become me.</p>
        <p>My Motivations:</p>
        <p>I found out that anyone can change his/her own world and eventually the world at large if they decide to.</p>
        <li>Men/Women are born to make the world a better place hence i decided to take that role seriously and do my possible best.</li>
        <li>The earth is all we have and need to make our lives and the world beautiful and sustaining</li>
        <li> Being Generous and self giving is fulfilling and the one thing that can enable me play this role is to become a solution.</li>
        <li> Making things work for others sparks the life out me.. its a great feeling to be helpful.</li>
        <li>Life is for a moment so leaving a mark is the least anyone can do for the next generation.</li>
        <li>Invest myself into my world leaving with nothing when my day comes calling.</li>

    <p>Before i went to the university i worked for two companies. in these companies i learned most of what i know today. Whiles at the University i decided to start a company to build website for companies and make a bit of cash to support myself. </p>
    <p>That how i started PED Solutions LTD</p>
    <p>PED Solutions LTD was my First Company, the experience with PED has made who i am today and given me the values i used to approach business problems. </p>
    <p>During my time in PED i discovered the importance of creating value for clients and developing strong relationships with them that goes beyond the boundaries of the office setting, of course i had no office so i literally had to go beyond the office setup :) ... </p>
    <p>My PED Experience has thought me about some important things when it comes to solving problems.</p>
    <p> - Solution must affect revenue directly or indirectly.<br>
      - Solution must increase productivity and decrease waste and Cost.<br>
      - Solution must affect the public image( with respect to Client Customers, Competitions, Employees, Society, Good will etc) of the client positively.<br>
      - Solution must exceed client expectation.</p>
